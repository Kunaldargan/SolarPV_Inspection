## 🌞 Galactica Solar Inspection - Project Overview

**Galactica Solar Inspection** is an intelligent solar energy monitoring platform designed to streamline inspection, analysis, and maintenance operations of solar photovoltaic (PV) panel installations. Built using Django and Python, the platform serves as the digital backbone for real-time performance tracking and fault detection, improving operational efficiency in solar farms or rooftop installations.

### 🧠 Problem Statement

The solar energy industry faces several challenges when it comes to **maintaining peak panel efficiency** and **ensuring rapid issue resolution**, such as:

* **Manual inspections** are labor-intensive and slow.
* **Inefficient fault detection** leads to energy losses.
* **Lack of historical data analytics** makes it hard to optimize panel layout or detect recurring problems.
* **Difficult coordination** between technicians, operators, and engineers on large-scale sites.

### 🎯 Project Scope

#### 🎛️ Core Functionalities

1. **Dashboard & Visualization**

   * Real-time status of solar panels (e.g., output, temperature, degradation).
   * Health check summaries and performance trends over time.

2. **Automated Inspection Scheduling**

   * Trigger inspections based on anomaly scores, time intervals, or maintenance logs.
   * Calendar-based view for scheduled and completed inspections.

3. **Fault Detection Engine**

   * Automatically analyze data (or drone imagery) to detect common PV issues such as:

     * Hotspots
     * Cell degradation
     * Dirt accumulation
     * Shading anomalies

4. **Reporting & Notifications**

   * Generate inspection reports.
   * Email/SMS alerts to technicians or admins.

5. **User Roles & Access**

   * Role-based access for Admins, Inspectors, Engineers, and Operators.

6. **Audit Logging**

   * Detailed logs for every action, change, or inspection.

#### 📈 3. Predictive Maintenance Forecasting

* **Type**: Time Series Forecasting
* **Input**: Maintenance logs, usage patterns, panel metadata
* **Output**: Remaining Useful Life (RUL), probability of failure
* **Algorithms**: ARIMA, LSTM (long short-term memory networks)

#### 🛰️ 4. Drone Image Analysis (Optional/Planned)

* **Input**: Thermal/Visual imagery from drones
* **Output**: Fault heatmaps over the panel array
* **Techniques**: Object Detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN), Image Segmentation
